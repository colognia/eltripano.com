# About

I started learning coding in march 2023 and this is my first trial costumer. Since march I code little by littel while learning more and more and meanwhile the site is already quite big.
Probably right now not the cleanest code in the world, but it is evolving and I continue learning and working on the site.
In june 2023 I joined a programming boot camp (Technigo - Swedish) to get more professional, which lasts 6 months.

## My process

- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with Firefox/opera and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools, checking stackoverflow and https://forum.freecodecamp.org/ and sometimes asking questions there.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned
Started off just with the main page, later adding "about us" section, impressum, contact section, footer, offers. In may I wanted to create a hamburger menu for the navbar for the mobile view, but because I dit not know JS, I found a solution just with css on youtube, which I had to adapt. Really tricky, but after several days I got it. 

Moreover I learned how to deal with the stakeholder. Because they do not know scrum, we maintain a doc-file where we write down all tasks in an enumerated list, things to fix and the day sth got finished.

### Continued development
Now that I know more I would code some things differently, but one after the other. The stakeholder wants his site in spanish and english as well. So this is another task for the future.
